"Hepatocellular Carcinoma[SEP]A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes.

Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor.

"Subclavian Steal Syndrome[SEP]An uncommon neurovascular condition seen with exertion of the upper extremity. It is usually caused by atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In order to maintain adequate perfusion of the arm during exercise on the affected side, the narrowed subclavian artery siphons off retrograde blood flow from the ipsilateral vertebral artery. This is possible due to lower blood pressure distal to the site of narrowing and collateral circulation through the circle of Willis. Affected individuals may remain asymptomatic until the oxygen demand generated from upper extremity exercise requires a large enough compensatory volume of blood to be diverted from the vertebral artery to provoke vertebrobasilar insufficiency and its accompanying neurological sequelae. Presenting clinical signs may include pain or numbness of the affected arm (with diminished pulses and a brachial systolic blood pressure differential of greater than 20 mmHg as compared to the opposite arm), vertigo, tinnitus, dysarthria, diplopia and syncope. Notably, unlike cerebral infarction, the clinical course does not lead to chronic neurologic disability.

Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months.

Clinical signs of the inherited deficiency present within the first decade of life and are consistent with the signs of recurrent systemic infection or immune complex disease.

"Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy[SEP]A rare, primary humoral immunodeficiency of childhood characterized by decreasing serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) as maternal antibodies clear the circulation while serum levels of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M remain normal or are slightly decreased.

This disorder may be caused by inadequate activation of progenitor B cells, defective class-switching or may even represent a maturational variant. Typically, a normal response to protein antigens is found while there is a notably diminished response to viral and bacterial polysaccharide antigens.

"Complement Deficiency[SEP]A broad classification for rare genetic disorders with mostly autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance. They are caused by the ineffective or decreased biosynthesis of complement components. Complement deficiencies may also be acquired acutely post-infection or chronically from co-morbid autoimmune disorders. If complement components are adequately synthesized, their rapid depletion may result in functional deficiencies. Clinical signs of inherited deficiencies present within the first decade of life and are consistent with the signs of recurrent systemic infection or immune complex disease. Complement deficiencies decrease the effectiveness of the humoral immune response. Of all the complement deficiencies, C3 deficiency is associated with the poorest prognosis since it presents at an early age, when susceptibility to recurrent infection is great. Deficiencies of C3 and of the classical activating pathway components: C1, C4, C2 also predispose to immune complex disease.[SEP]Complement Deficiency[SEP][CLS]primary immunodeficiency disease[SEP]An immune system disease that results when one or more essential parts of the immune system is missing or not working properly at birth due to a genetic mutation.[SEP]immunodeficiency syndrome[SEP]hypoimmunity[SEP]immune deficiency disorder","1"

"Complement Deficiency[SEP]A broad classification for rare genetic disorders with mostly autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance. They are caused by the ineffective or decreased biosynthesis of complement components.

Clinical signs of inherited deficiencies present within the first decade of life and are consistent with the signs of recurrent systemic infection or immune complex disease. Complement deficiencies decrease the effectiveness of the humoral immune response. Of all the complement deficiencies, C3 deficiency is associated with the poorest prognosis since it presents at an early age, when susceptibility to recurrent infection is great. Deficiencies of C3 and of the classical activating pathway components: C1, C4, C2 also predispose to immune complex disease.[SEP]Complement Deficiency[SEP][CLS]duodenum disease[SEP]An intestinal disease that is located_in the duodenum.[SEP]duodenal disease[SEP]duodenum disorder","0"

"Subclavian Steal Syndrome[SEP]An uncommon neurovascular condition seen with exertion of the upper extremity. It is usually caused by atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In order to maintain adequate perfusion of the arm during exercise on the affected side, the narrowed subclavian artery siphons off retrograde blood flow from the ipsilateral vertebral artery. This is possible due to lower blood pressure distal to the site of narrowing and collateral circulation through the circle of Willis. Affected individuals may remain asymptomatic until the oxygen demand generated from upper extremity exercise requires a large enough compensatory volume of blood to be diverted from the vertebral artery to provoke vertebrobasilar insufficiency and its accompanying neurological sequelae. Presenting clinical signs may include pain or numbness of the affected arm (with diminished pulses and a brachial systolic blood pressure differential of greater than 20 mmHg as compared to the opposite arm), vertigo, tinnitus, dysarthria, diplopia and syncope. Notably, unlike cerebral infarction, the clinical course does not lead to chronic neurologic disability.
